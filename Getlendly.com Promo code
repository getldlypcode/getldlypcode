Payday loans are small, short term loans which are usually extended till the next payday. The usual duration of these loans is just a few weeks and such loans are taken to meet expenses till the next payday. These types of loans are typically involve small amounts ranging from £500 to about £1000. Payday loans are also known as cash advance and the interest rate is on the higher side.

The loan process

To successfully apply for this type of loan, a borrower needs to have a steady job and a functional bank account as payday loans are extended on the basis of salary. To repay the loan the borrower needs to issue a post dated cheque or arrange for automatic debit from the bank account to cover the loaned amount and the interest thereof.

In the event of the cheque getting returned for any reason, there will be an extra levy of late charges and cheque bouncing charges besides a levy of additional interest. To help borrowers avoid this type of situation, payday loan lenders extend the deferral facility where the repayment of loan can be deferred by a certain period for a fee if funds are not available for repayment.
