I have not done a payday loan in five years nor will I ever again.

Back then I was married and my husband had a really good job, until he lost it about 3 months after I got a payday loan. Of course he had been out of work for medical reasons so the checks he was receiving from work were not as much as he was bringing home when working. This put us in a financial strain that resulted in us eventually losing almost everything.

I had been working at the time although we were scraping by. I wanted to get a bill paid so I went to one of those payday loan places. I had not ever done one before and I didn't have the credit to just go to my bank and get a loan.

What people do not understand is that you pay the amount borrowed (or allowed to borrow) plus a huge interest rate back. Rates vary from payday loan to payday loan but they are excessively high. And the way many payday loans catch your attention is no fees for new business. That is one thing that attracted me to more than one place.
